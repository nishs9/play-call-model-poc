## NFL Playcall Predictor Model

This is a little project I am working on to create an ML model that can predict the next play call (in an NFL game) based on a given game state. This is a part of the work that I am doing for a different project(s) called the NFL Simulation Engine:

The data that this model relies on comes from a public repo provided by nflverse. I use the play-by-play data specifically for this project but the repo has even more detailed data from current and past seasons. All of this data can be accessed and downloaded from [here](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases).
