This is where I store the raw data while working on the model locally. The raw play-by-play CSVs are pretty large and seemed unnecessary to host in this repo as they are publicly available for download here: https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases. You can see examples of the pre-processed training data in the `training_data` folder.
